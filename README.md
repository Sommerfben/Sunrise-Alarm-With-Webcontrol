Sunrise Alarm With Webcontrol

Toggles a GPIO pin on when the system time matches a set alarm time, which can then be hooked to a relay to allow for control of much larger LED lights. Physical power on and off buttons can be added to GPIO pins. 

Also uses Flask to host a simple webpage to allow toggling via a webbrowser.
